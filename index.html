              Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and
              published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the
              Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance
              from Ken Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for
              the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing video games
              (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their developersLet

                creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to
                new players. Water is the most common type with over 100
                Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other
                sea-dwelling creatures.

                of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a

                  The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that
                  discussion. In the process of getting out their doors and
                  visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost
                  in spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim
                  for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and
                  December.

                  <p>Mimikyu caused quite a stir for its peculiar looks and sad backstory when it was originally announced for Pokémon Sun and Moon in 2016. Mimikyu is described as a Pokémon who felt so lonely that it decided to wear a rag in order to look like Pikachu, everyone’s favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its actual appearance is unknown. A scholar who saw what was under its rag was overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock.</p>

                  <p>Charizard is an orange draconic Pokémon who has a fiery temper. It is the final evolution of Charmander, one of the starter Pokémon for the original game. Pokedex says: Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.

                <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
                  <ol class="qnalist">
                    <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?
                      <ul>
                        <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>
                        <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?
                      <ul>
                        <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.
                        </li>
                        <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

                      The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were
                      created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and
                      Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime
                      after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
                      Green version was not released outside Japan
